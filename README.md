# Fig: The Data Science Framework

## Supported Commands

### fig new

`$ fig new <name>`

This would take the `<name>` you provided and create a whole new python project, that looks similar to the diretory layout in the [directory design](./directory.md) in a sub-directory named `<name>` directory. You have to `cd` into that folder. This will give you the basic structure to immediately get started.

### fig serve

`$ fig serve`

This command starts up a development mode server to allow for local API testing, in the foreground. Stop it with `CTL+C`.
